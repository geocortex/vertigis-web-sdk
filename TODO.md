-   Project creation CLI
-   Reference `@vertigis/web` npm package
-   Change from `webzoo.latitudegeo.com` to `apps.geocortex.com` for the default web viewer url
-   Think about supporting injecting libraries via URL to simplify SDK
    -   Iframe page likely no longer necessary
    -   Better future compat
    -   **Would have to be careful about XSS attacks by providing a malicious URL to unsuspecting user**
